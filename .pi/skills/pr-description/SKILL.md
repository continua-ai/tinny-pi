# PR Description Style (Continua)

Use this template for PR descriptions:

```
## Summary
- <short, understated description of change>
- Value: <why this helps users; keep it concrete>
- Vibe-coded (<scope note, e.g. docs-only change>)

## Testing
- <tests run>
```

Guidelines:
- Keep the tone understated and matter-of-fact.
- Always include a value statement (e.g., "read agent questions while typing because the editor/footer stay pinned").
- Always include a vibe-coded note.
- If tests were not run, say: "Not run (not requested)."
